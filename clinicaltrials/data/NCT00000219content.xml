                The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and immunological effects of the
                phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, CC-10004, on skin inflammation associated with cutaneous
                lupus erythematosus.

            <textblock>
                Discoid cutaneous lupus is the most common cutaneous manifestation of lupus erythematosus, a
                chronic, immune mediated disease of unknown etiology.  The immune processes underlying
                cutaneous lupus remain largely unexplored, but recent evidence suggests a role for dendritic
                cells (DCs), type 1 interferons (IFN) and Th1-type immune processes.  Treatment of cutaneous
                lupus remains limited primarily to anti-malarials, with thalidomide an effective secondary
                agent.  However, side effects associated with these treatments are potentially problematic
                with chronic use.  Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are critical enzymes that degrade cAMP.  In
                particular, PDE type 4 (PDE4) activity is found in inflammatory and immune cells, including
                DCs. The immune modulator CC-10004 is a PDE4 inhibitor with demonstrated low toxicity in
                phase I and II clinical studies with potential efficacy in cutaneous lupus. CC-10004 is a
                well-tolerated, selective PDE4 inhibitor with demonstrated inhibitory effects on Th1-type
                cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and is under development for the treatment of
                inflammatory and immune mediated conditions.  Prior studies include pilot trials in
                psoriasis and exercise-induced asthma, with results suggesting clinical efficacy in the
                former study. This open label, pilot study of 16 weeks duration will explore the clinical
                and immune-modulating effects of CC-10004 in 10 cutaneous discoid lupus patients.  Patients
                meeting study criteria will receive the drug for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout
                period.  Study visit time points will include weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16, during
                which we will measure outcomes for clinical, immunological and safety parameters.  To
                investigate early immunological changes occurring in response to treatment, we will also
                perform skin punch biopsies of lesional sites at week 0 and week 4 for immunohistochemical
                and molecular analysis.

        <brief_summary>
            <textblock>
                When one receives a local anesthetic, such as novocaine for a dental procedure, there is a
                burning painful sensation experienced upon injection of the local anesthetic. We are trying
                to understand the role of pH (how acidic a solution is) in the production of pain during
                local anesthetic administration. We hypothesize that less acidic solutions produce less
                burning. We also want to determine whether or not the pH of the solution affects the rate of
                onset of the local anesthesia. We will recruit subjects from patients who have a clinical
                indication for lumbar medial branch (LMB) nerve blocks, procedures frequently performed at
                the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Pain Medicine. For each patient, three nerve
                blocks are administered at adjacent spinal levels, typically using either lidocaine or
                bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine as the local anesthetic. We will add a saline control as part
                of the research procedure and then provide lidocaine at the control location before
                continuing with the nerve blocks. This clinical procedure offers an ideal opportunity to
                compare the effects of the three solutions. There will be almost no deviation from the
                standard clinical procedure. After the injection of each solution, the pain score on
                administration of the medication will be recorded immediately. We will also provide a
                continuous stimulation (pin taps) after the local anesthetic injection and record when the
                patient experiences hypoesthesia (reduced sensation) and anesthesia (absent sensation).
                Finally, we will record the pain score upon reinsertion of a needle to mark the precise
                location (part of the clinical procedure) one minute after the local anesthetic injection.
                All data will be collected during the a single clinical visit.

                The study will conclude when 60 subjects have successfully been tested. Data will be
                reviewed annually.
